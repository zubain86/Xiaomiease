# Xiaomiease-
The basic idea to build this application is to write a common code that can work on android, iOS and windows. To achieve this following cross platform technologies are used-<br/>
(1) Flutter <br/>
(2) Firebase <br/>
(3) GetX <br/>
# About the application-
To understand well about the application let's first get insights of the technologies used-
## Firebase-
Firebase provides various services like authentication, real time hosting of databases, notifications and various set of hosting services for any type of application. This application is capable of utilising all the services provided by the firebase but as of now it is using authentication service.<br/>

## Flutter + GetX-
Dart is the programming language used to code Flutter apps. Both frontend and backend is written in dart.A basic pubspec is generated when you create a new Flutter project. It's located at the top of the project tree and contains metadata about the project that the Dart and Flutter tooling needs to know. 
#### Frontend
Flutter includes a full set of widgets that deliver pixel-perfect experiences whether you're building for iOS (Cupertino) or other platforms (Material), along with support for customizing or creating entirely new visual components.
#### Backend
Flutter code is powered by the world-class Dart platform, which enables compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android, as well as JavaScript for the web and Intel x64 for desktop devices.

#### GetX
When flutter is capable of handling frontend and backend both then why getx is used?? <br/>
It is a library in flutter that can perform simplified-<br/>
(1) State Management <br/>
(2) Route Management <br/>
(3) Dependancy Management <br/>
It simply eases the backend managemnet in flutter apps.<br/>
